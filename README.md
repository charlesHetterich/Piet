#Piet
######April 2015

This was one of the first big projects I got to work on in a while becuase in 11th grade it was difficult to find a lot of time to consistently program. I was comming up with ideas for this game for several months, and I spent all of my spring break working on it so I had a very clear idea of what I wanted. The original inspiration for Piet was the artist Piet Mondrian. I wanted to make a game that looked like his art.

I was very serious about this project and meant for it to be a full game with many levels, worlds and different interactive game mechanics. After creating a basic level editor, I started to realize that my design and art skills were still lacking far to much to be able to create this. I spent a long time trying to make the game feel smoother, but eventually I decided I needed to move on. This is a project I want to come back to in the future.
